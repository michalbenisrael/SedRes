# SedRes
This is a MatLab based model that calculates residence times of sediments in reives using cosmogenic nuclide exposure times.
The following scripts were written as part of the the publication "Sediment Residence Times in Large Rivers Quantified Using a Cosmogenic Nuclides Based Transport Model and Implications for Buffering of Continental Erosion Signals" JGR: Earth Surface.
